# loop through tuple items by referring to their index number. Use range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable

# print all items by referring to their index number:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for i in range(len(thistuple)):
    print(thistuple[i]) # => apple banana cherry
