# unpacking (extracting the values back into a variable)
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
(green, yellow, red) = fruits

print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)
# => apple banana cherry

# if the number of variables doesn't match the number of values in the tuple, you can use an asterisk to collect the remaining values as a list
