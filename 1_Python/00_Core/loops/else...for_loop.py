# the else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:

# print all numbers from 0 - 5, and print a message when the loop has ended:
for x in range(6):
    print(x)
else:
    print("All done looping!") # => prints 0 - 5 with message "All done looping" at the end
