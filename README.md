Hi! I'm Josh Hayles. I'm a Solutions Engineer @ Datadog. I'm a tech-enthusiast (especially Real Estate Tech), and a student of Software Engineering for web development.

Project30 is my one year experiment learning Python, DSAs, Databases, and more. It consists of 12, thirty day challenges, each one with a specific focus.
