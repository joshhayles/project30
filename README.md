## Introduction
Hi! I'm Josh Hayles. I graduated from Flatiron as a Software Engineer. This is my documentation for Algo practice and Algo solutions. My primary focus is Javascript. 

## Before I start coding
1. Rewrite the problem in my own words
2. Validate that I understand the problem
3. Write my own test cases
4. Pseudocode
5. Code!
