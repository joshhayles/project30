# Introduction
Hi! I'm Josh Hayles. I'm a Solutions Engineer @ Datadog. I'm a tech-enthusiast (especially Real Estate Tech), and a student of Software Engineering for web development.

Practice30 is my one year experiment learning Backend Development: Python, DSAs, APIs, Databases, and more. It consists of using 30 minute intervals for highly-focused practice sessions to learn a specific topic. Each 30 minute interval is called a "session". My goal is to complete 4 sessions (two hours) each day.
