# Strategy

    ## Read. Recite. Record. Review. Repeat
        - Read a section of material. Close it and hide notes
        - Recite everything I can remember about what I read
        - Record, or write the code to the best of my ability
        - Review the material and correct what needs correction
        - Repeat at least three times, or until code can be written from scratch

    ## Meaningful application and connection
        - Apply what I'm learning and connect it in a meaningful way that helps internalize the material. 
        - Use mental imagery to help solidify the concepts.

    ## Test myself
        - Build a project
        - Solve quick exercises / problems

# Pomodoro Technique (Interval Training)
        - 25 minutes of work
            - 5 minute break
        - 3 cycles is 90 minutes
        - 4 cycles is 120 minutes (2hrs)
